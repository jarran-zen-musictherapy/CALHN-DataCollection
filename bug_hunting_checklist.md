# Bug Hunting Checklist

This is a simple checklist to guide you through the process of identifying and fixing bugs in your code.

## Pre-Hunting Preparation
- [ ] Understand the expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- [ ] Gather all relevant information (error messages, logs, user reports)
- [ ] Reproduce the bug in a controlled environment

## Investigation Steps
- [ ] Isolate the bug: Narrow down the conditions that trigger it
- [ ] Check recent changes: Review code commits or updates that might have introduced the issue
- [ ] Examine logs and error messages: Look for stack traces or clues
- [ ] Use debugging tools: Set breakpoints, inspect variables, or use profilers
- [ ] Test edge cases: Consider unusual inputs or scenarios

## Resolution
- [ ] Identify the root cause
- [ ] Develop a fix: Write minimal code changes to address the issue
- [ ] Test the fix: Ensure it resolves the bug without introducing new ones
- [ ] Verify in different environments: Check on various browsers, devices, or systems if applicable
- [ ] Document the fix: Update comments, commit messages, or issue trackers

## Post-Fix Actions
- [ ] Run regression tests: Make sure existing functionality still works
- [ ] Communicate the fix: Inform team members or users if necessary
- [ ] Learn from the bug: Consider what could prevent similar issues in the future

Remember, patience and systematic approach are key to effective bug hunting!</content>
