# How to Update the OOS Data

## What you need

Edit access to the three Google Sheets (Jarran will share these with you).

## Adding a new month's data

1. Open the relevant sheet (MT / Art Therapy / Spiritual Care)
2. Add a new row at the bottom
3. Fill in: Year, Month, New (if known), Review (if known), Total
4. Leave New and Review blank if you only have a total figure
5. Save — the graph updates automatically next time someone opens it

## That's it. The graphs read directly from the sheet. No coding. No other steps.
